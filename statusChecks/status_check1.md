1. We have begun constructing a protoptye to test the code on, we have begun to code and test the code, and we started to Cad the system.
2. We do not need to order anything.
3. We have started to cad the chassis but have not finished as we want to have a somewhat finished product, and then build around it.
4. Our output display is an LCD screen, user input is buttons that select the direction and time, our autonomous input is a distance sensor, our actuators are motors, and our miscelaneous materials include programmed logic, menu software, and data storage and retrieval.
5. The three most challenging parts of this project will be finishing the code, cad-ing the car chassis, cad-ing the slots and spaces for everything.
