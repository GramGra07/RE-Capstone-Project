# Launch Description

## Project Description
We would like to build a robot that would be able to be programmed by a person as to how many cm to go in each direction. The person would press buttons to select steps, after this you would hit a button to execute the steps. It would take input from a distance sensor to make sure it wouldn't crash into something. We would show output back to the user with some sort of display, maybe a LCD or another display.

## Looks:
It will look like a car with 4 wheels, and we will try to make it as pollished as possible.

## Basis for this project
We wanted to do this project based on the idea of programming a user input, and translating it into robot movements.
