# RE-Capstone-Project
## By Graden Gentry and Zale Diawara

# Launch Description

## Project Description
We have built a robot that will be able to be programmed by a person as to which direction, and how far in that direction. The user will press buttons to select steps, after this, they will hit the accept button again to execute the steps. It takes input from a distance sensor to make sure it won't crash into something. It shows output back to the user with an LCD screen. There are two battery packs, one 9V battery for the Arduino, and one 12V battery for the motors. There are two power switches and they each must be on for the robot to function. It has a distance sensor in the front and will stop if anything is closer than 10 cm, then it will print out that it has stopped on the LCD screen.

## Looks:
It will look like a car with 4 wheels, and we will try to make it as polished as possible.
It will have four different colored buttons on the top as well as an LCD screen embeded into the top.

## Basis for this project
We wanted to do this project based on the idea of programming a user input, and translating it into robot movements.
We use a certain code, like F6R9L0F8, and translate that into how the robot will move. In that case, Forward 60, Right turn and then Forward 90, Left turn and Forward 0, then finally Forward 80. The main idea is to create our own code, and then read through it and perform those programmed actions.
